## Welcome to Puzzyx Challenge!

We are very happy to see you here! 

**Before starting please make sure to fill your details [here](https://forms.gle/6QxSXJ7SWPtWXrP99) to join the shuffle.**

Puzzyx is a multiplatform application created by lovely Bumble developers using Appyx where we aim to
finish a puzzle with content created by Droidcon attendees! Pick you photo or text content, add it to puzzle and 
let it shine on our screen! ✨✨


**Here is what you need to do to create your own tile:**

- Get familiar with [Entry](./shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/bumble/puzzyx/model/Entry.kt) class and its types
- Pick an Entry type you would like to add
- Shout out to Droidcon what you want to say
- Or get your cool/funny photo and add it to [Resources](./shared/src/commonMain/resources/participant)
- Add your `Entry` instance to the list in [Entries.kt](./shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/bumble/puzzyx/model/Entries.kt)
- Your tile is good to go! All you need to do is create your PR and ask Bumble team for review!

**Please be mindful about created content, Bumble keeps the right of rejecting a PR. 
Any remote images, hate speech, discrimination or explicit content is not allowed.*
